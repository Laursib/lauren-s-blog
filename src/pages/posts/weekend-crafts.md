As a mom of two young kids, finding time for DIY projects can feel impossible. But I've discovered some creative ways to squeeze in some crafting during those precious nap times. Here are five quick projects that won't break the bank or take up your whole day.

## 1. Photo Memory Jars

All you need is:
- Clean glass jars
- Photos
- Mod Podge
- Brush

This takes about 30 minutes and creates beautiful decorative pieces from items you probably already have at home.

## 2. Washi Tape Picture Frames

Transform plain picture frames with washi tape patterns. It's quick, removable if you change your mind, and kids can help when they wake up!

## 3. No-Sew Fabric Bunting

Perfect for decorating the kids' room or for parties. Just cut triangles from fabric scraps and attach them to ribbon with fabric glue.

## 4. Painted Plant Pots

Basic terracotta pots become beautiful decor pieces with some acrylic paint and creativity. Plus, they're great for growing herbs in the kitchen!

## 5. Cork Board Organizer

Turn a simple cork board into a stylish command center with fabric, ribbons, and pushpins. Perfect for keeping track of family schedules!
