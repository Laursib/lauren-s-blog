Traveling with kids doesn't have to mean expensive resorts or theme parks. Here's how we manage to explore and create memories without spending a fortune.

## Local Adventures First

We've discovered that kids find adventure everywhere! Some of our favorite experiences have been:
- City parks we've never visited before
- Nature trails within driving distance
- Free museum days
- Local festivals and events

## Planning Tips

1. Travel during off-peak seasons
2. Use credit card rewards for flights
3. Book apartments with kitchens instead of hotels
4. Pack snacks and lunch boxes
5. Look for "kids eat free" deals

## Making Memories

The best part? Kids don't care about luxury hotels or expensive attractions. They remember:
- Playing in new playgrounds
- Picnics in different places
- Meeting other kids
- Simple adventures like riding local buses
- Collecting rocks, leaves, or shells

Remember: It's not about how far you go or how much you spend - it's about the experiences you share together!
